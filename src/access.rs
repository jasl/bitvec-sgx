/*! Governs access to underlying memory.

`bitvec` allows the logical capability of a program to produce aliased
references to memory elements which may have contended mutation. While `bitvec`
operations are guaranteed to not observe mutation outside the logical borders of
their domains, the production of aliased mutating access to memory is still
undefined behavior in the compiler.

As such, the crate must never produce references, either shared or unique,
references to memory as the bare fundamental types. Instead, this module
translates references to `BitSlice` into references to shared-mutable types as
appropriate for the crate build configuration: either `Cell` in non-atomic
builds, or `AtomicT` in atomic builds.

/** Access interface for shared/mutable memory access.

`&BitSlice` and `&mut BitSlice` contexts must route through their `Access`
associated type, which implements this trait, in order to perform *any* access
to underlying memory. This trait extends the `Radium` element-wise shared
mutable access with single-bit operations suited for use by `BitSlice`.
