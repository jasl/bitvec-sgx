/*! `bitvec` – `[bool]` in overdrive.

This crate provides views into slices of bits that are truly `[u1]`. Each bit in
the data segment is used, unlike `[bool]` which ignores seven bits out of every
byte.

`bitvec`’s data structures provide strong guarantees about, and fine-grained
control of, the bit-level representation of a sequence of memory. The user is
empowered to choose the fundamental type underlying the store – `u8`, `u16`,
`u32`, or `u64` – and the order in which each primitive is traversed –
big-endian, from the most significant bit to the least, or little-endian, from
the least significant bit to the most.

This level of control is not necessary for most use cases where users just want
to put bits in a sequence, but it is critically important for users making
packets that leave main memory and hit some external device like a peripheral
controller or a network socket. In order to provide convencienc to users for
whom the storage details do not matter, `bitvec` types default to using
big-endian bit order on `u8`. This means that the bits you would write down on
paper match up with the bits as they are stored in memory.

For example, the bit sequence `[0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]` inserted into `bitvec`
structures with no extra type specification will produce the `<BigEndian, u8>`
variant, so the bits in memory are `0b01101001`. With little-endian bit order,
the memory value would be `0b10010110` (reversed order!).

In addition to providing compact, efficient, and powerful storage and
manipulation of bits in memory, the `bitvec` structures are capable of acting as
a queue, set, or stream of bits. They implement the bit-wise operators for
Boolean arithmetic, arithmetic operators for 2’s-complement numeric arithmetic,
read indexing, bit shifts, and access to the underlying storage fundamental
elements as a slice.

(Write indexing is impossible in Rust semantics.)

/** Perform single-bit ripple-carry addition.

This function performs carry-aware binary addition on single bits of each
addend. It is used in multiple places throughout the library, and so is pulled
here for deduplication.

# Parameters

- `a: bool`: One bit of addend.
- `b: bool`: One bit of addend.
- `c: bool`: The carry-bit input.

# Returns

- `.0: bool`: The sum of `a + b + c`.
- `.1: bool`: The carry-out of `a + b + c`.
